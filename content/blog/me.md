### About Me

Hi, I’m Komeil Parseh. I have a strong interest in programming, particularly with Linux, Python, Rust, and C. I enjoy taking on new projects and contributing to open-source initiatives.

On my GitHub, you’ll find several projects that reflect my interests. For example, **[Flask-tinydb](https://github.com/mmdbalkhi/Flask-tinydb)** is a TinyDB extension for Flask, designed to simplify database interactions. **[Mozlink](https://github.com/mmdbalkhi/mozlink)** is a program for building short links using Python and Flask, while **[breeze](https://github.com/mmdbalkhi/breeze)** is a fun Flask application that mimics Twitter.

I’ve also contributed to documentation for Flask and other related projects, which has been a valuable way to support the community and improve resources for other developers.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing Dota 2, and watching anime—**Steins;Gate** is one of my favorites.

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile to see more of my work. Thanks for stopping by!
